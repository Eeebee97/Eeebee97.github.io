    <h1>My name is Ethan Brinn</h1>
    <p>
      I am a Network Management student.
      I am not a traditional student and will be retiring from my first career in the summer of 2024.
      I have been married for 22 years and my son is in high school.
      I enjoy woodworking and sports officiating in my spare time.
